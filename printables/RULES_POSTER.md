### HOW TO PLAY

1. **FIND** - Locate QR codes for any branch
2. **SCAN** - Solve puzzles in order (Step 1 → 2 → 3)
3. **UNLOCK** - Complete branches to earn digits
4. **HUB** - 2 branches = Hub unlocks (get permutation key)
5. **VAULT** - 4 branches = Enter the vault code!

---

### KEY FACTS

- All 4 branches can be worked **at the same time**
- Within a branch, solve Step 1 before Step 2 before Step 3
- **Global progress**: Once ANYONE solves a step, the next unlocks for ALL
- Each solve = 1 raffle entry for YOU

---

### THE MATH

When all branches are done:
1. Collect digits in order: FOOD → MUSIC → DECOR → BOOKS
2. Apply the permutation key (shown in Hub)
3. First 6 digits = Vault code
